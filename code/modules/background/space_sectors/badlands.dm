	name = SECTOR_BADLANDS
	description = "The Badlands are home to some of the Orion Spur's most savage flora and fauna, a phenomenon that attracts only the wildest and wisest of the system's inhabitants - xenobiologists, \
	weapon scientists, there's even a market for mercenaries, in the hunting of the particularly large and lethal creatures. Of course, there are also those looking to make a life for themselves, \
	but natives aren't known to treat settlements kindly."

/datum/space_sector/new_ankara
	name = SECTOR_NEW_ANKARA
	description = "New Ankara is the home system of the Republic of Elyra. Its capital is Persepolis. The planet was originally an arid planet with a modest atmosphere and stubborn \
	native ecosystems already present. Original Alliance-funded terraforming efforts transformed the planet into an Earthlike planet within a decade, allowing the population to flourish \
	before and after independence. Commercial and service sector jobs remain the highest employer, second to refineries processing phoron or other minerals transported to the planet's \
	orbit. This is among the primary locations in Elyra where phoron can be found in abundance."

	almost perpetual snowfall and extremely low temperatures. Adhomai is the only habitable world in its system and has a mass one quarter larger than Earth's."

	description = "Hro'zamal is the second planet in the Nrrahrahul system. Formerly named Nrrahrahul Two, it was given the name Hro'zamal after the establishment of a permanent civilian \

	Tajara can survive in these regions without the use of suits. The use of acclimatization systems is necessary during the \
	warmer seasons."
